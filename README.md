# micro-color-sudoku

Hosted at https://wizardly-goodall-08ea4f.netlify.app/

Sudoku with colors, for desktop and mobile.
 
Dual purpose as a toy for a small child as well as getting my feet wet with [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) + [vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) using [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) tooling. 

Very rudimentary in both styling and function, and still missing a proper puzzle generator.
